# Captcha_Model_Training_using_Tensorflow
i am going to train a captcha model of 6 letter using python tensorFlow.

The Captcha model of 6 letter including number i have train a model of captcha using tensorflow to predict captcha for automating the captcha.
before automating captcha i have first import all images aprox 4000 images.
then i have make list of two data one of image and other of images lable . label for training the model on image.

before training model i have preprocess the image, in image preprocessing first i have clean the image for better image recogination. 
 after cleaning image i have converted the image in to array and make take stack. of image array and lablel.

after that create model and train model for prediction.

for more information please check my jupyter notebook.
